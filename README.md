# Python-HWID-Lock

I created this piece for a project that i didnt end up completing. This script will scan a pastebin link and search for a HWID that is in there. The script will carry on if the user's HWID is in the pastebin "database" and the script will stop and print an error if the HWID isnt in the "database"


This was not made for malicious purposes nor was it intened to be used for malicious use.

This is made for the code to be put onto a python script and then for that script to be compiled into an exe, this is a great script if you are making programs you want only one user to use and not send to other people

Have fun,

Underscore

(This is final i will not be updating the code as it gets older)
